There is a cat contest which displays the pictures you can vote on




After authenticating to the web app there is an endpoint that stands out to me.

look for .git


└─$ feroxbuster -u http://cat.htb -w /home/skid/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt  


This command above allowed me to find .git database

http://cat.htb/.git



there is a 
accept_cat.php endpoint which we dont have access to. I assume this is what we must figure out how to access

You’re on the right track! Take a look at the user registration file—you’ll find another vulnerability there. The one you just spotted will come in handy in the next step. As for the XSS you mentioned, you’ll find it in that other file. If you need another hint or something more direct, just let me know! And yes, it has to do with the name, but not that parameter.

I believe this is in the input parameter in email where XSS is. or somewhere
